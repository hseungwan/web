    <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I am Seung Wan Ha, a first-year Ph.D. Student in Health Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, USA, advised by Dr. Christina Chung at ProHealth lab. My research focuses on Health Informatics, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and CSCW.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a researcher, I am interested in new ways that allow people to extend one’s range of understanding. My goal is to research these ways to foster better human-to-others (such as robots, virtual avatars, and other people) understanding and to enhance the relationship between humans and others. I am also interested in new media that allows one to extend and assist one’s experience. With new interactions and technology, this media enables people to create their own experience easily by using assistive tools with multi-modal interactions.
